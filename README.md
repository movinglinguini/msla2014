## Modelling Substructural Logics in Agda

#### Abstract

> In this paper, we will examine models of substructural logics in
> Agda. The reason for this is that most existing models formalise
> intuitionistic logic and are entirely unsuitable to modelling
> substructural logics. In recent years, however, substructural logics
> have seen a surge in usage.
>
> Concretely we present the reader with an explicit model of
> intuitionistic logic, and derive models for linear logic and the
> Lambek-Grishin calculus. In addition, we show how to reify proofs in
> these logics into terms in Agda. All this is implemented as an Agda
> library, which is made available on GitHub.

> Finally we conclude with an example from formal linguistics in which
> we demonstrate one possible usage of our implemented Agda library.
